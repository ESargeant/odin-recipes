    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an amazing recipe for making a savory ribeye with a beautiful sear</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) (2-inch-thick) rib-eye steaks </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground black pepper </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons canola oil </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed </li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt flakes to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove steaks from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Position racks in the middle and lower third of the oven. Place a cast iron skillet on the bottom rack. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top.</li>
        <li>Pat the steaks dry with a paper towel and season generously on all sides with salt and pepper. Place on the wire rack on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Continue baking, checking internal temperature every 10 minutes, until steaks reach 120 degrees F (49 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
        <li>Use an oven mitt to remove the hot cast iron skillet from the oven. Set it over medium-high heat on the stovetop. Add oil; heat until it barely starts smoking. Carefully add the steaks, releasing them away from you so the oil doesn't splatter in your direction. Cook until a golden crust forms, turning only once, 2 minutes per side. Use tongs to stand steaks on their sides to render any fat.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and add butter, rosemary, and garlic. Baste steaks with the butter mixture using a spoon, about 3 minutes. Move steaks onto a cutting board and let rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve steaks whole or sliced, finished with sea salt flakes.</li>

    </ol>
